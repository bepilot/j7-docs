   Sitara Machine Learning toolkit brings machine learning to the edge by enabling 
   machine learning inference on all Sitara devices (Arm only, Arm + specialized hardware 
   accelerators). It is provided as part of TI's Processor SDK Linux, free to download 
   and use. Sitara machine learning today consists of TI Deep Learning (TIDL), Neo-AI-DLR, 
   TVM runtime, TensorFlow Lite, Arm NN, and RNN library.
