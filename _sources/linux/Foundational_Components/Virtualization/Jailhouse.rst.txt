Jailhouse Hypervisor
=======================

.. include:: /replacevars.rst.inc

.. rubric:: Overview
   :name: overview-virtualization

Jailhouse is a static partitioning hypervisor that runs bare metal
binaries. It cooperates closely with Linux. Jailhouse doesn't emulate
resources that don't exist. It just splits existing hardware resources
into isolated compartments called "cells" that are wholly dedicated to
guest software programs called "inmates". One of these cells runs the
Linux OS and is known as the "root cell". Other cells borrow CPUs and
devices from the root cell as they are created.

.. Image:: /images/Jailhouse.png

The picture above shows the jailhouse on a system a) before the
jailhouse is enabled; b) after the jailhouse is enabled; c) after a cell
is created.

Jailhouse consists of three parts: kernel module, hypervisor firmware
and tools, which a user uses to enable the hypervisor, create a cell,
load inmate binary, run and stop it. Jailhouse is an example of
Asynchronous Multiprocessing (AMP) architecture. When we boot Linux on
devices wih ARM CPU clusters, Linux uses all the cores. After we
enable hypervisor it moves Linux to the root-cell. The root cell still
uses all the CPU cores. When we create a new cell, hypervisor calls
cpu\_down() for some of the CPU cores to offline them. The new cell
will use these CPU cores and hardware resources dedicated for this cell in
the cell configuration file.

Jailhouse is an open source project, which can be found on
https://github.com/siemens/jailhouse.

Keystone3 Jailhouse Demo
---------------------------

The goal of this demo is to partition the CPU cores and run a second instance of
the Linux kernel with a ramfs root filesystem. The inmate kernel will use the
secondary UART to provide a login shell to the user.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PLSDK')

    .. rubric:: Step 0: Create SD card with default images
       :name: keystone3-jailhouse-demo-step0

    Please follow the instructions for the `Create SD Card Script <../../Overview/Processor_SDK_Linux_create_SD_card_script.html#sd-card-using-default-images>`__
    and when prompted to select the root filesystem image, select the default 'tisdk-rootfs-image'
    image.

.. rubric:: Step 1: Host Setup
   :name: keystone3-jailhouse-demo-step1

As we will be running two instances of the Linux kernel, two terminals are
required. Connect one terminal to the primary UART (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0) and the
other to the secondary UART (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB1).

.. rubric:: Step 2: Configure U-Boot
   :name: keystone3-jailhouse-demo-step2

The default boot configuration does not reserve any resources for the Jailhouse
hypervisor nor the inmates. However, the root filesystem contains a device tree
overlay that will carve out these requirements. U-Boot must be configured to
apply this device tree overlay.

For this step, we will be using the terminal connected to the primary UART.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PLSDK')

    Power up the board and stop the boot process within U-Boot.
    
    We will need to add the jailhouse device tree overlay to the list of overlays to
    apply. By default, U-Boot uses the "name_overlays" environment variable to
    provide the list of overlays. However, this variable is automatically set by
    U-Boot based on the board, and as such, anything saved to this variable will be
    overwritten upon the next boot. Therefore we will define a new variable
    "extra_overlays" and modify the "findfdt" function for it to take effect.
    
    In U-Boot, type the following to enable use of this new variable.
    
    ::
    
        => printenv findfdt
        setenv name_fdt k3-am654-base-board.dtb;setenv fdtfile ${name_fdt};setenv overlay_files ${name_overlays}
    
        => setenv findfdt 'setenv name_fdt k3-am654-base-board.dtb;setenv fdtfile ${name_fdt};setenv overlay_files ${name_overlays} ${extra_overlays}'
    
        =>
    
    
    Now add the jailhouse device tree overlay to the "extra_overlays" variable and
    save the environment.
    
    ::
    
        => setenv extra_overlays k3-am654-base-board-jailhouse.dtbo
    
        => saveenv
    
        => 


.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PSDKL')

    We will need to add the jailhouse device tree overlay to the list of overlays to
    apply in u-boot.This is controlled by the environment variable "overlay_files".
    |__SDK_FULL_NAME__| comes with readymade uenv.txt where this variable is set to
    define the list of DTBO files for running the jailhouse demo. Refer to the section
    `How to Change dtb File <How_to_Guides/Target/How_to_Change_dtb_File.html>`__
    for more details on this.

.. rubric:: Step 3: Boot Linux and login
   :name: keystone3-jailhouse-demo-step3

Now boot the kernel and log in to the shell:

.. rubric:: Step 4: Run the Jailhouse linux-demo
   :name: keystone3-jailhouse-demo-step4

The jailhouse package contains a single script to run the Linux inmate demo.
This script combines the typical jailhouse commands to simplify running the demo
for the first time. This script performs the following steps.

#. Enables jailhouse by loading and running the hypervisor firmware and
   configuring the root cell.
#. Creates the inmate cell, providing it with its resources.
#. Loads the inmate into memory.
#. Starts the inmate.

To run the demo, run the linux-demo.sh script.

    Processor Linux SDK delivers Jailhouse’s prebuilt binaries. You may
    try it immediately after installation. This section assumes that you
    have already installed PLSDK, and have Linux booted on the AM572X-EVM
    or AM572x-IDK.
    
    **NOTE:** *to use Jailhouse hypervisor*
    
    1) set u-boot environment variable optargs*: setenv optargs vmalloc=512M
    
    2) use \ **am572x-evm-jailhouse.dtb** for AM572x-EVM
    or \ **am572x-idk-jailhouse.dtb** for AM572x-IDK
    
    .. rubric:: Pre-built components
       :name: pre-built-components
    
    As it was mentioned in the previous section, Jailhouse consists of
    following components, which are prebuilt and copied to the target
    filesystem:
    
    #. jailhouse.ko kernel module located at
       /lib/modules/4.19.38-<gitid>/extra/driver directory;
    #. jailhouse.bin - hypervisor itself located at /lib/firmware directory;
    #. Jailhouse management tools are located at
       /usr/local/libexec/jailhouse and /usr/sbin directories;
    
    In order to create the root-cell and an inmate cell we need to provide
    cell configuration files. Those configuration files and example binaries
    are located at /usr/share/jailhouse/examples directory:
    
    ::
    
        root@am57xx-evm:/usr/share/jailhouse/examples# ls -1

       inmate example and its cell configuration (led\_test.bin can be run
       on AM572x-EVM only);
    -  **pruss.bin** and **am572x-rtos-pruss.cell** - TI-RTOS PRUSS inmate
       examples and its cell configuration (pruss.bin can be run on
       AM572x-IDK only);
    -  **icss\_emac.bin** and **am572x-rtos-icss.cell** - TI-RTOS ICSS-EMAC
       inmate example and its cell configuration (icss\_emac.bin can be run
       on AM572x-IDK only);
    -  **linux-loader.bin** - loader required to run inmates, which start
       address is not 0x0. Not required at current and above versions of Jailhouse.
       Cell configuration can define starting address.

    **NOTE** Starting from this version of Jailhouse Inmate library stratup code
    enables MMU. The library initializes only GIC controller and debug UART
    memory. Memory for all other regions has to be initialized by inmate itself.
    At this release the ti-app is not updated. All RTOS examples don't use the
    inmate library and initilizes their MMU regions by themselves.

    **NOTE**: because all of the components: root-cell, hypervisor and demo
    inmate use the same UART, there is a conflict. Once the inmate started
    to use the UART, Linux stops getting any input from console. To
    workaround this and continue to control the hypervisor, you may telnet
    to the EVM and issue all commands from the telnet shell. Hypervisor
    still will use Linux console to print it sdebug messages

    **NOTE:**
    This example just demonstrates hypervisor's ability to run binaries
    that were built outside of jailhouse source tree. This and other RTOS
    examples were ported for this purpose. Look to RTOS SDK documentation
    for description of the examples functionality.  
    
    .. rubric:: Running the Demo on AM572x-IDK
       :name: running-the-demo-on-am572x-idk
    
    Two TI-RTOS example applications were ported for Jailhouse hypervisor:
    pruss.bin and icss\_emac.bin. In contrast to led\_test.bin, which has
    its own startup code, linker script and was linked to start from address
    0x0, the pruss.bin and icss\_emac.bin used the TI-RTOS building
    infrastructure as much as possible. **At the previous Processor SDK
    pruss.bin and icss\_emac.bin were linked to the default 0x80000000 address.
    Because the new Jailhouse version uses that address for debug URAT
    communication region, the RTOS application are linked to the 0x90000000
    address**. 
    
    To run the pruss.bin application enable the hypervisor the same way as
    for other examples.

    .. rubric:: Jailhouse Performance on AM5728
       :name: jailhouse-performance-on-am5728
    
    To verify the real-time performance of Jailhouse Sitara AM5728 was setup
    to run Linux on one of the ARM Cortex A15 cores, and a TI-RTOS inmate on
    the other A15 core. A test was run to measure interrupt latency. Poll
    mode driver based application performance of an inmate should be
    identical to a system without virtualizationion in a static partitioning
    system like Jailhouse. Anything interrupt based is required to share the
    interrupt controller (GIC) which will introduce some interference from
    Linux to the real-time application. The measurements shown below over a
    million interrupts clearly shows the interference, and captures the
    upper bound at 8.8us. For the first run of interrupt latency test an
    unloaded Linux running on core 0 is in the first column. In the second
    column Linux on core 0 is running STREAM. STREAM is an external memory
    access benchmark that fully utilizes the number of outstanding reads and
    writes to memory. It is scalable from individual processors to clusters
    supercomputers, here it is used at the processor level. It was chosen as
    representative of a worst case memory access behavior of a Linux based
    application on a Cortex A15, essentially with a memory access profile
    like an optimized memorytomemory copy. In AM5728 the two Cortex A15
    cores share L2 cache and access to the rest of the SoC, which the STREAM
    benchmark running on core 0 stresses while core 1 access GIC registers
    to respond to the interrupt.

    Jailhouse sources are located at
    $TI\_SDK\_PATH/board-support/extra-drivers/jailhouse-0.7 directory. The
    directory contains the following subdirectories:
    
    -  **Documentation**
    -  **ci** - configuration files for different platforms. ***Copy the
       jailhouse-config-am57xx-evm.h file into hypervisor/include/jailhouse
       directory and rename it to config.h***
    -  **configs** - cell configuration files.
    -  **driver** - jailhouse.ko kernel module code
    -  **hypervisor** - hypervisor code
    -  **inmates** - inmates demos. It also contains code for ti\_app inmate
       example.
    -  **scripts**
    -  **tools** - jailhouse management utility
    
    The top level SDK Makefile has the **jailhouse\_clean**, **jailhouse** and
    **jailhouse\_install** targets which can be used to clean, build and
    install jailhouse to the target file system.

    .. rubric:: Building and Running the Ethercat Slave Demo
       :name: building-and-running-the-ethercat-slave-demo
    
    To build and run the Ethercat Slave Demo, you need to install the
    PLSDK-RT, PRSDK and PRU-ICSS-ETHERCAT-SLAVE builds. We assume that you
    already have the first two SDKs installed. The PRU-ICSS-ETHERCAT-SLAVE
    can be downloaded from
    http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-industrial-sw/esd/PRU-ICSS-ETHERCAT-SLAVE/01_00_05_00/index_FDS.html.
    
    Once you have this SDK installed you may build Ethercat slave
    components.
    
    If the am572x-ethercat.cell is not installed on target filesystem yet,
    build it from PLSDK-RT top level makefile "make jailhouse" and copy it
    to target under /usr/share/jailhouse/examples.
    
    To build the ethercat\_slave\_demo.bin:
    
    -  Modify the IA\_SDK\_HOME at
       ~/ti/processor\_sdk\_rtos\_am57xx\_[version]/demos/jailhouse-inmate/rtos/ethercat\_slave\_demo/Makefile
       to point to the install directory of PRU-ICSS-ETHERCAT-SLAVE.
    -  At
       ~/ti/processor\_sdk\_rtos\_am57xx\_[version]/demos/jailhouse-inmate/makefile:
       add ethercat\_slave\_demo\* entries as pruss-test/icss-emac-test to
       the end of the makefile
    
    ::
    
        ethercat_slave_demo:
            $(MAKE) -C ./rtos/ethercat_slave_demo
    
        ethercat_slave_demo_clean:
            $(MAKE) -C ./rtos/ethercat_slave_demo clean
    
        ethercat_slave_demo_install:
            $(MAKE) -C ./rtos/ethercat_slave_demo install
    
    -  cd ~/ti/processor\_sdk\_rtos\_am57xx\_[version]/
    -  source setupenv.sh
    -  cd
       ~/ti/processor\_sdk\_rtos\_am57xx\_[version]/demos/jailhouse-inmate
    -  source setenv.sh
    -  make ethercat\_slave\_demo
    
    After the steps above, copy ethercat\_slave\_demo.bin to target under
    /usr/share/jailhouse/examples.
    
    To run the inmate refer to the instructions for `**Running the Demo on
    AM572x-IDK** <#running-the-demo-on-am572x-idk>`__ . Be aware that the
    inmate start address is 0x90000000. So, it has to be set at the cell
    configuration and also used as a parameter at the "jailhouse cell load" command:
    
    ::
    
        jailhouse cell load 1 ethercat_slave_demo.bin -a 0x90000000
    
    
    Procedure to check two-way communication between the slave inmate and
    the master station:
    
    -  Refer to
       http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/PRU_ICSS_EtherCAT#Running_EtherCAT_Slave_Application
       to setup Ethercat master.
    -  Master: Online write [data] to RxPDO 32Bit Output. After this, the
       slave should report the corresponding value via Board\_setDigOutput.
       The value can be checked with “devmem2 0xeef00000” also.
    -  Slave: devmem2 0xeef00004 b [data]. After this, Master should display
       the corresponding value in TXPDO 32Bit Input.

.. rubric:: Jailhouse Internals
   :name: jailhouse-internals

This section gives some Jailhouse details and required kernel
modifications.

.. rubric:: Linux Kernel Modifications
   :name: linux-kernel-modifications

In order to run hypervisor itself and inmates, jailhouse requires
additional nodes in kernel dtb. Refer to platform-specific jailhouse device tree
or DT overlay for details on the required nodes or modifications.

.. rubric:: Memory Reservation
   :name: memory-reservation

Linux kernel has to reserve some memory for jailhouse hypervisor and for
inmate. This memory has to be reserved statically. Following example shows
reservation of 16MB physical memory for hypervisor and 16MB for inmates.

::

    / {

        reserved-memory {
            jailhouse: jailhouse@ef000000 {
                reg = <0x0 0xef000000 0x0 0x1000000>;
                no-map;
                status = "okay";
            };

            jh_inmate: jh_inmate@ee000000 {
                reg = <0x0 0xee000000 0x0 0x1000000>;
                no-map;
                status = "okay";
            };
        };
    };

.. rubric:: Hardware Modules Reservation
   :name: hardware-modules-reservation

Jailhouse is a partitioning hypervisor. This means a HW peripheral is
in exclusive control of one of the cells. Jailhouse cell config file
defines this ownership to ensure that all accesses to peripherals
are isolated between different cells. Access to any peripheral outside
of the owned will be treated as violation, and jailhouse will park that
cell. To ensure that Linux uses only the assigned peripheral, we can
disable the peripherals which are owned by the other cell.

Following nodes describe an example of how devices are disabled in the
root cell device tree.

::

    /* Disable uart used by inamte cell */
    &main_uart1 {
            status = "disabled";
    };
    
    /* Disable emmc instance used by inamte cell */
    &main_sdhci0 {
            status = "disabled";
    };

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PLSDK')

    Linux kernel enables all SOC HW modules which are required for its
    configuration. Appropriate drivers configure required clocks and
    initialize HW registers. For all unused IPs, clocks are not configured.
    Also, kernel power management can put a module into the sleep mode. A
    jailhouse inmate doesn't share the same hardware module with Linux
    kernel (except debug UART). But the inmate doesn't configure required
    clocks and doesn't deal with power domains. So, we still rely on Linux
    kernel (at least at the current release) to configure clocks to inmate
    HW modules. If we want to use some hardware modules for an inmate, we
    have to tell kernel about this in advance.
    
    The following nodes disable using of the timer8 and uart9 by kernel.
    Also, this restricts kernel to put those IPs to sleep mode.
    
    ::
    
        &timer8 {
            status = "disabled";
            ti,no-idle;
        };
    
        &uart9 {
            status = "disabled";
            ti,no-idle;
        };
    
    You may see other nodes in the jailhouse DTSes which reserve other IPs
    to be used for inmates. Thus, IDK's DTS disables nodes, which IPs are
    used for icss\_emac and pruss inmates.

    .. rubric:: GIC Interrupt Inputs Reservation
       :name: gic-interrupt-inputs-reservation
    
    Interrupt lines from hardware modules don't go to ARM interrupt
    controller (GIC) directly. They go to a crossbar register, which selects
    a GIC distributor input. The selection is done dynamically by Linux
    kernel. Linux keeps track of all used and unused GIC inputs. If a
    jailhouse inmate has to use an interrupt, it has to configure the
    crossbar register by itself. To prevent conflicts between the Linux
    crossbar manager and the inmate, and give to the inmate some unused GIC
    input lines, which it can use, we need to reserve some of them in the
    kernel dts.
    
    This can be done by adding GIC input numbers to the "ti,irqs-skip"
    property of the "crossbar\_mpu:" node. Lines 134 and 135 are added to
    the following node.
    
    ::
    
               crossbar_mpu: crossbar@4a002a48 {
                    ti,irqs-skip = <10 133 134 135 139 140>;
                };
    
    **Note:** The icss\_emac.bin application uses much more interrupt
    lines. That is why IDK's dtb skips additional interrupts.
    
    ::
    
                crossbar_mpu: crossbar@4a002a48 {
                    ti,irqs-skip = <10 44 127 129 133 134 135 136 137 139 140>;
                };

.. rubric:: Root-cell configuration
   :name: root-cell-configuration

When hypervisor is being enabled, it creates a cell for Linux and moves
it to that cell. The cell is called as "root-cell". The cell
configuration as a "\*.c" file which is compiled to a special binary
format "\*.cell" file. The hypervisor uses the "cell" file to create a
cell. The cell configuration describes memory regions and their
attributes which will be used by the cell:

::

Following code snippet shows the bitmap of CPU cores dedicated for the cell:

::

    .cpus = {
            0x3,
        },

Following code snippet shows the bitmap of interrupt controller SPI interrupts:

::

       .irqchips = {
            /* GIC */ {
                .address = 0x48211000,
                .pin_base = 32,
                .pin_bitmap = {
                    0xffffffff, 0xffffffff, 0xffffffff, 0xffffffff
                },
            },
            /* GIC */ {
                .address = 0x48211000,
                .pin_base = 160,
                .pin_bitmap = {
                    0xffffffff, 0, 0, 0
                },
            },
        },

These settings are for all cells.

In addition, the root cell also allocates the physical memory for
the hypervisor.

::

           .hypervisor_memory = {
                .phys_start = 0xef000000,
                .size = 0x1000000,
            },

The "memory regions" section is used by hypervisor to create the second
stage MMU translation table. Usually for root-cell, the identical mapping
is being used - "VA = PA".

.. rubric:: Bare Metal Inmate Example
   :name: bare-metal-inmate-example

Jailhouse comes with inmate demos located at the **inmates/demos**
directory. Current (v0.6) version has two demo inmates: **gic-demo** and
**uart-demo**. Those are very simple bare-metal applications that
demonstrate a uart and arm-timer interrupt. Those demos are common for
all jailhouse platforms.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_sdk in ('PLSDK')

    More interesting may be the **ti-app**, a demo made especially for
    AM572x SOC. The code is located at the **inmate/ti\_app** directory.
    
    Basically this application is a sandbox to make some experiments. The
    current version demonstrates using a uart, timer and a GIC SPI
    interrupt (timer generates periodic interrupts). The application also
    has some extra code, which was used to measure interrupt latency.
    
    As any inmate, the ti-app inmate works in a cell. The am57xx-evm-ti-app.c
    is the cell configuration file. For this cell, only ARM1 core will be
    used:
    
    ::
    
           .cpus = {
                0x2,
            },
    
    **NOTE:** Actually on am572 SOC, which has only 2 ARM core and Linux
    always uses the ARM0 core only ARM1 can be taken for an inmate.
    
    The cell configuration has 5 memory regions:
    
    ::
    
               /* UART... */ {
                    .phys_start = 0x48020000,
                    .virt_start = 0x48020000,
                    .size = 0x1000,
                    .flags = JAILHOUSE_MEM_READ | JAILHOUSE_MEM_WRITE |
                        JAILHOUSE_MEM_IO | JAILHOUSE_MEM_ROOTSHARED,
                },
                /* UART... */ {
                    .phys_start = 0x48424000,
                    .virt_start = 0x48424000,
                    .size = 0x1000,
                    .flags = JAILHOUSE_MEM_READ | JAILHOUSE_MEM_WRITE |
                        JAILHOUSE_MEM_IO | JAILHOUSE_MEM_ROOTSHARED,
                },
                /* TIMER... */ {
                    .phys_start = 0x48826000,
                    .virt_start = 0x48826000,
                    .size = 0x1000,
                    .flags = JAILHOUSE_MEM_READ | JAILHOUSE_MEM_WRITE |
                        JAILHOUSE_MEM_IO | JAILHOUSE_MEM_ROOTSHARED,
                },
                /* L4_CFG */ {
                    .phys_start = 0x4a000000,
                    .virt_start = 0x4a000000,
                    .size = 0xE00000,
                    .flags = JAILHOUSE_MEM_READ | JAILHOUSE_MEM_WRITE |
                        JAILHOUSE_MEM_IO | JAILHOUSE_MEM_ROOTSHARED,
                },
                /* RAM */ {
                    .phys_start = 0xee000000,
                    .virt_start = 0,
                    .size = 0x800000,
                    .flags = JAILHOUSE_MEM_READ | JAILHOUSE_MEM_WRITE |
                        JAILHOUSE_MEM_EXECUTE | JAILHOUSE_MEM_LOADABLE,
                },
    
    Two for UARTs. The first one for UART3, which is a standard EVM debug
    uart. The second for UART9, using of which requires some board
    modifications. But UART9 doesn't conflict with Linux or hypervisor and
    may be more useful if the inmate needs a dedicated UART. One region for
    timer9 and one for access multiple configuration registers.
    
    The last region is for RAM allocated for the inmate. Similar to
    root-cell memory regions configuration memory mapping for all regions
    except for RAM are identical (VA = PA). For the RAM region virtual
    address has to be '0'. The physical addresses of the region must be
    inside of the physical memory reserved for inmates in the Linux DTS
    file.
    
    In the .irqchip section of the cell configuration file we reserve GIC
    interrupt line #134 (**One of two lines reserved in the kernel DTS**).
    
    ::
    
          
            /* GIC */ {
                .address = 0x48211000,
                .pin_base = 160,
                .pin_bitmap = {
                    0x00000040,
                },
            },
    
    Here where #134 comes from. The 0x00000040 is the bitmask of the sixth
    bit. So, .pin\_base(160) + .pin\_bitmap(6) - 32(number of SWI and PPI
    interrupt) = 134.
    
    As other jailhouse demos the **ti-app** uses the jailhouse startup code,
    which sets the inmate vector table, zeros BSS segment, sets the stack up
    and calls the inmate\_main(). The initialization of the GIC controller
    is done by hypervisor. Also the hypervisor remaps GICC interface to GICV
    interface and intercepts all inmates accesses to GICD. It allows to
    read/write only GICD registers, related to the lines given in the
    .irq\_chips section. In our case for the line #134 only.
    
    In the inmate\_main() the inmate initializes uart, sets the crossbar and
    calls the gic\_setup() to set the inmate's interrupt handler. The
    jailhouse provides inmate interrupt controller API. This can be used by
    inmate.
    
    The ti-app initializes the timer and enters to the infinite loop.
    
    Actually the inmate code has only about 100 lines and doesn't require
    any more explanation.
    
    .. rubric:: RTOS PDK Inmates
       :name: rtos-pdk-inmates
    
    The jailhouse demo applications and the "ti\_app" are built by
    jailhouse's makefile inside the jailhouse's source tree. It is more
    interesting to build an inmate outside of the jailhouse source tree,
    using independent makefile and third party libraries. This release
    provides **led\_test**, a simple example of a bare-metal application,
    which uses prebuilt RTOS PDK libraries and is built independently on
    Jailhouse. It also has ports of two TI RTOS SYSBIOS test applications -
    pruss and icss\_emac. There are two other examples: 1) bare-metal
    memcp\_bm - a simple application to measure memory bandwidth; 2)
    Ethercat\_slave\_demo - ported to Jailhouse example from "PRU-ICSS
    Industrial Software for Sitara™ Processors". The example requires some
    modifications of the PRU-ICSS Industrial Software, which is not
    published yet. That is why the ethercat\_slave\_demo included here as a
    reference only.
    
    The code of the applications is located on the
    $(SDK\_INSTALL\_PATH)/processor\_sdk\_rtos\_am57xx\_4\_01\_00\_04/demos/jailhouse-inmate
    directory, which contains:

    .. rubric:: Bare-metal example
       :name: bare-metal-example
    
    The bare-metal directory has three subdirectories: **soc** - has common
    for bare-metal applications soc specific code; **led** - led\_test
    application code; **memcp\_bm** - memcp\_bm code;
    
    The **soc/am572x/evmAM572x** sub-directory contains:
    
    -  **entry.S** - startup file for an inmate;
    -  **gic.c** - has the dummy \_weak\_ INTCCommonIntrHandler(), which can
       be overridden by an actual application handler.
    -  **linker.cmd** - jailhouse requires that an inmate shall start from
       address "0". It also requires that all inmates segments be located in
       contiguous memory. This linker.cmd is to meet these requirements.
    
    The **led** directory contains:
    
    -  The main inmate **led\_test.c** code. This file is based on
       $(SDK\_INSTALL\_PATH)/pdk\_am57xx\_1\_0\_6/packages/ti/board/diag/led/src/led\_test.c
       diagnostic application. Because the inmate works as a virtual machine
       in order to use caches MMU has to be enabled. So, the application
       creates the MMU translation table with identical mapping and enables
       MMU. It also has the gic\_init(), which is now used at this relese.
    -  **makefile** is to build the inmate. As you can see, it links number
       of brebuilt PDK libraries.
    
     
    To build the **led\_test.bin** (a jailhouse inmate has to be \*.bin,
    but not \*.out file):
    
    -  cd to
       $(SDK\_INSTALL\_PATH)/processor\_sdk\_rtos\_am57xx\_4\_01\_00\_04
       drectory
    -  source setupenv.sh
    -  cd to
       $(SDK\_INSTALL\_PATH)/processor\_sdk\_rtos\_am57xx\_4\_01\_00\_04/demos/jailhouse-inmates
    -  source setenv.sh
    -  run **make led\_test**
    
    That should build the led\_test.bin binary, that can be loaded to the
    jailhouse cell and run. As any other inmate it has to be run in a cell,
    created with appropriate cell configuration. In contrast to the
    led\_test.bin, which is compiled independently on jailhouse, a
    corresponding cell configuration is compiled by jailhouse makefile.
    
    The am57xx-pdk-leddiag.c cell configuration file is located in the
    $TI\_SDK\_PATH/board-support/extra-drivers/jailhouse-0.7/configs
    directory. Use the compiled am57xx-pdk-leddiag.cell file when you create
    the cell for led\_test.bin inmate.
    
    See `Running the Demo on AM572x-EVM <#running-the-demo-on-am572x-evm>`__ or `Running the Demo on AM572x-IDK <#running-the-demo-on-am572x-idk>`__ to run the inmate.
    
    The **memcp\_bm** is very similar to led\_test. It is built in the same
    way as the led\_test. Use the am57xx-bm.cell file from
    $TI\_SDK\_PATH/board-support/extra-drivers/jailhouse-0.7/configs to
    create the jailhouse cell for the memcp\_bm inmate.
    
    .. rubric:: RTOS BIOS Examples
       :name: rtos-bios-examples
    
    The pruss and icss\_emac examples are located in the rtos/pruss and
    rtos/icss\_emac directories. The structures of the both directories
    are identical. Each directory contains the bios and src
    subdirectories. The bios contains XDC type application configuration
    file and makefile. The configuration file is reworked copy of the
    original RTOS application configuration file. For example the
    configuration file for icss\_emac inmate was ported from
    $(SDK\_INSTALL\_PATH)/ti/pdk\_am57xx\_1\_0\_7/packages/ti/drv/icss\_emac/test/am572x/armv7/bios/icss\_emac\_arm\_wSoCLib.cfg
    file. As far as jailhouse inmate is not responsible for board related
    configuration, the board library, i2c library, OCRAM MMU sections and
    some other unnecessary for the inmate components were removed from the
    configuration file.
    
    As far as the application main function calls the board\_init()
    function, this function as well as the Board\_moduleClockInit() (with
    required for icss\_emac application clocks) are implemented in the
    idkAM572x\_jh.c file.
    
    Thus the ported configuration file, the idkAM572x\_jh.c and makefiles
    are only new files required to port RTOS SDK existing project to
    jailhouse inmate.
    
    The jailhouse-inmate/Makefile has the "pruss\_test" and
    "icss\_emac\_test" targets to build the BIOS inmates.
    
    The structure of the ethercat\_slave\_demo example is very similar to
    the pruss and icss\_emac examples. As far as it depends on a particular
    version of the "PRU-ICSS Industrial Software", which has to be installed
    independently, building of the demo is not included into the top level
    makefile.
    
    .. rubric:: RTOS BIOS Porting Notes
       :name: rtos-bios-porting-notes
    
    As you can see in the previous section, the RTOS BIOS inmates has only
    few new files. Almost all files were reused from RTOS SDK examples. But
    following notes have to be considered when porting an RTOS BIOS
    application to a Jailhouse inmate.
    
    Jailhouse inmate runs in a small cell. The cell is created by
    hypervisor, which was started from already booted Linux OS. That says
    that the SOC, board and most clocks are already initialized and the
    inmate don't need and usually cannot touch any resources not listed in
    the inmate cell configuration file.
    
    Thus the using of board and i2c libraries were removed from
    cponfiguration file. Also OCRAM was removed from MMU configuration.
    
    Jailhouse hypervisor allows inmate to access certain GICD registers, but
    only for those interrupt lines, which are listed in the cell
    configuration file. The cell creating routine reconfigures GICD target
    registers by itself. The standard gic\_init() BIOS API configures target
    registers for all interrupt lines. That is not permitted for an inmate.
    To avoid this the latest SYSBIOS release has a special feature, which
    allows to disable target configuration from GIC initialization function.
    See the following fragment at the configuration file:
    
    ::
    
        var Hwi = xdc.useModule('ti.sysbios.family.arm.gic.Hwi');
        Hwi.initGicd = false;
    
    The RTOS BIOS applications are built to \*.out format. RTOS loader may
    load this file to the board even if the image has multiple sections with
    their addresses spread across the entire SOC address range. The
    Jailhouse supports only \*.bin format, and inmate may use only allocated
    for it memory carved out from Linux. Therefore the ported application
    shall use only limited memory.
    
    Jailhouse may start an inmate that start from virtual address 0x0, but
    an usual RTOS application is linked to the 0x80000000 address and with
    different from that entry point. The Jailhouse allows to start such
    applications (see above). But using the linux-loader required additional
    node in the inmate cell configuration.
    
    ::
    
               /* RAM loader */ {
                    .phys_start = 0xed000000,
                    .virt_start = 0x0,
                    .size = 0x10000,
                    .flags = JAILHOUSE_MEM_READ | JAILHOUSE_MEM_WRITE |
                        JAILHOUSE_MEM_EXECUTE | JAILHOUSE_MEM_LOADABLE,
                },
                /* RAM RTOS 224MB*/ {
                    .phys_start = 0xe0000000,
                    .virt_start = 0x80000000,
                    .size = 0xd000000,
                    .flags = JAILHOUSE_MEM_READ | JAILHOUSE_MEM_WRITE |
                        JAILHOUSE_MEM_EXECUTE | JAILHOUSE_MEM_LOADABLE,
                },
    
    You may see that cell configuration for icss\_emac inmate configures
    two RAM regions:
    
    #. small one with virtual address 0x0 for the linux-loader;
    #. main region for the icss\_emac test itself;
    
    .. rubric:: General Porting Notes
       :name: general-porting-notes
    
    When you start porting your RTOS or bare-metal application to Jailhouse
    inmate, you have to consider several things. They are listed below.
    This list is not complete and has just recommendations based on common
    sense and previous porting experience.
    
    -  **Linux always starts first** before hypervisor. Linux initializes
       all (or almost all) common resources of SOC. Thus it initializes
       memory controller, clocks, interrupt controller etc. It configures
       PINMUX registers. In most cases it takes care about board
       configuration as well.
    
    -  **Inmate Cell Configuration** defines resources, which are available
       for the inmate. The ported application can use only those resources
       and responsible for theirs initialization only. The ported
       application will not run on the board it used to run, but on a
       different **virtual board**, defined by the cell configuration. Thats
       is why the application cannot use any common board\_init or soc\_init
       functions that may touch used by Linux resources. **Inmate is a guest
       only**.
    
    -  As it mentioned above Linux initializes **Interrupt Controller** and
       dynamically configures crossbar registers. It has to be planned ahead
       which interrupts inmate may use. Those interrupts has to be reserved
       at Linux's dts file. Also used by the inmate interrupts have to
       listed in the inmate cell configuration. Hypervisor configures GIC
       target registers for those interrupt. Inmate is responsible only for
       enabling, disabling and acknowledging the interrupts.
    
    -  Linux owns **I2C** buses. Inmate cannot has its owe driver to control
       I2C bus. It is not practicable even if the both root-cell and inmate
       cell configurations share I2C region and Linux and the Inmate have an
       agreement not to use I2C at the same time. The problem is that the
       Linux I2C driver works in interrupt mode and if the Inmate issues an
       I2C transaction, Linux's interrupt handler will be called. It brakes
       the Linux's and Inmate's I2C drivers state machines (or whatever they
       have).
    
    -  Using **GPIO** may have the same as I2C problem. It is easy to
       disable an entire GPIO bank from using by Linux and use it for the
       Inmate. But it is not practical to share the same bank by the both
       Linux and Inmate.
    
    -  Even if it is possible to dedicate a timer for an inmate, the source
       clock for that timer still comes from the SOC clock tree. That means
       the parent clock for that timer will be controlled by Linux. So, if Linux
       has enabled clock frequency scaling it may change the frequency of the timer's
       source clock and that affects the timer. The inmate will not have any means to
       disable that behavior. To avoid that Linux should run at a fixed OOP.

    .. rubric:: Migration from Jailhouse v0.8 to v0.10
       :name: migration from jailhouse v0.8 to v0.10
    
    -  The v0.10 Jailhouse has common debug UART that is shared between root-cell,
       hypervisor and an inmate compiled with the inmate library. A cell
       configuration for each inmate. 
    
    shall have ".console" subnode in the
       ".cell" node
    
    ::
    
    		.console = {
    			.address = 0x48020000,
    			/* .divider = 0x0d, */
    			.type = JAILHOUSE_CON_TYPE_8250,
    			.flags = JAILHOUSE_CON_ACCESS_MMIO |
    				 JAILHOUSE_CON_REGDIST_4,
    		},
    
    **must have** /* communication region */ in the ".mem_region" node
    
    ::
    
    		/* communication region */ {
    			.virt_start = 0x80000000,
    			.size = 0x00001000,
    			.flags = JAILHOUSE_MEM_READ | JAILHOUSE_MEM_WRITE |
    				JAILHOUSE_MEM_COMM_REGION,
    		},
    
    -  all inmates that uses jailhouse inmate library shall add their memory
       regions to MMU table. This SDK doesn't provide examples to show that.
    
    -  for inmates are not started from 0x0 set the cpu_reset_address at cell
    configuration file
    
    ::
    
    	.cpu_reset_address = 0x90000000,
    
    -  The new Jailhouse version uses shared communincation regions started at VA
       0x80000000, which conflicts with the default RTOS memory configuration.
       All RTOS based inmate memory configuration has to be updated:
    
    #. DDR start address at linker script changed from 0x80000000 to 0x90000000
    #. Also update all RTOS inmate MMU congiration to reflect the new starting
       address
    #. As far as we don't use linux_loader anymore the RTOS imate has to start
       from address set at cpu_reset_address. You may need to set the application
       entry point explicitly at application configuration file
