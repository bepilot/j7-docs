USB0 controller operates in super-speed dual role mode and is available on a Type-C connector.

.. note::
   The Type-C config DIP switch (SW3) must be set for DRP (Dual-role-Port) operation. SW3.3 = OFF, SW3.4 = ON.

USB1 operates in high-speed host mode and is connected to an onboard 4-port HUB.
Of the 4 hub ports, 2 ports are available on stacked Type-A connectors, 1 is available
on J2 header for USB-WiFi/Bluetooth adapter and 1 is available on the **EVM EXPANSION** connector J51.

USB2 controller is not present on J721E SoC so micro-AB 3.0 connector is not usable.
