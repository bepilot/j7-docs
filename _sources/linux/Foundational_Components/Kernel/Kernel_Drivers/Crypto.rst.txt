   :name: introduction-linux-core-crypto

The Crypto API Driver is a set of Linux drivers that provide access to
the hardware cryptographic accelerators available on
AM335x/AM437x/AM57x/DRA7/AM65/J721E devices. These drivers are
available built-in in the kernel in the current SDK release.

Following are the Hardware accelerators supported on the following
devices:

::

    * AM335X       : MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, AES, DES
    * AM437X       : MD5, SHA1, SAH224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, AES, DES, DES3DES
    * AM57x/DRA7   : AES, DES, DES3DES
    * AM65x/J721e  : AES, DES3DES, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512

.. rubric:: Building the Driver
   :name: building-the-driver

For devices with available cryptographic hardware accelerators, a Linux
driver and additionally an Cryptodev (or OCF on AMSDK v6.0 or older)
kernel module (for OpenSSL) is needed to access them.  Other devices use
the pure software implementation of OpenSSL for the crypto demos.

.. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family', 'General_family')

    .. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('J7_family')

        .. rubric:: J721E specifics

        J721E SoCs support hardware accelerator for crypto operations
        (Security Accelerator Ultra Light).

    .. ifconfig:: CONFIG_part_family in ('General_family')

        .. rubric:: AM65 specifics

        AM65 SoCs support hardware accelerator for crypto operations
        (Security Accelerator Ultra Light).

    Current software support is added for IPSec use case. Once the basic
    strongswan and IPSec infrastructure is enabled on both host and target,
    one can start using IPSec.

    There is no support for Cryptodev kernel module for OpenSSL.
    Basic Crypto manager testing, Linux tcrypt testing & IPSec testing is done.
    The fragmentation test cases are not supported by the hardware for
    SHA1/256/512, and the driver makes use of software implementation.

       :name: am335x-am43xx---aes-des-shamd5-drivers

    Starting with **AMSDK 5.05.00.00**, the driver is completely integrated
    into the kernel source. The pre-built kernel that comes with the SDK
    already has the AES, DES and SHA/MD5 drivers built-in to the kernel. The
    kernel configuration has already been set up in the SDK and no further
    configuration is needed for the drivers to be built-in to the kernel.
    The configuration of the random number generator does require an extra
    step and this is detailed in the next section.

    For reference, the configuration details are shown below. The
    configuration of the AES, DES and SHA/MD5 driver is done under the
    Hardware crypto devices sub-menu of the Cryptographic API menu in the
    kernel configuration.

Support tools for the hardware random number generator can be loaded
from `rng-tools on
Sourceforge <http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/files/rng-tools/>`__.
The latest version at the time of this write-up is `version
3.0 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/files/rng-tools/3/>`__,
dated 2010-07-04.

**1.** We're still in the Linux-devkit environment. Download the file
rng-tools-3.tar.gz, and untar in a suitable location.

**2.** Change to the directory that contains the rng-tools distribution,
and configure the package:

::

    host $ ./configure --prefix=/home/user/targetfs/TI814x-targetfs_5_03_01/usr \
     --exec-prefix=/home/user/targetfs/TI814x-targetfs_5_03_01/usr \
     --host --target=arm-linux

**3.** Next make the **rngd** and **rngtest** executables.

::

    host $ make

**4.** Install the generated executables in the target filesystem.

**5.** Test the random number generator on the target.

Note that the results may be slightly different on your system, since,
after all, we're dealing with a random number generator. Any appreciable
number of errors typically indicates a bad random number generator.

If you're satisfied the random number generator is working correctly,
you can use **rngd** (the random number generator daemon) to feed the
/dev/random entropy pool.

.. rubric:: AES, DES, SHA Hardware Accelerators using Cryptodev
   :name: aes-des-sha-hardware-accelerators-using-cryptodev

The device drivers for AES, DES and SHA/MD5 hardware acceleration is
configured and built into the kernel by default. No other special setup
is needed for OpenSSL to access the crypto modules.

First, the kernel from the SDK must be configured and built according to
the SDK User's Guide.

The General Purpose (GP) EVMs on TI SoCs allows access to built in
cryptographic accelerators. Inorder to use these drivers from OpenSSL,
the drivers on their own have no contact with userspace. For this, a
special driver is available which abstracts the access to these
accelerators through Cryprodev module.

The demo application under the crypto menu of Matrix will load and use
the Cryptodev driver kernel modules automatically to perform hardware
accelerated crypto functions. The process of manually loading the kernel
modules and using the driver is explained below.

Cryptodev is itself a special device driver which provides a general
interface for higher level applications such as OpenSSL to access
hardware accelerators.

The filesystem which comes with the SDK comes built with the Cryptodev
kernel modules and the TI driver which directly accesses the hardware
accelerators is built into the kernel.

From the target boards perspective the drivers are located in the
following directories:

::

    /lib/modules/`uname -r`/extra/cryptodev.ko

To use the drivers they must first be installed. Use the modprobe
command to install the drivers. The following log shows the commands
used to install the modules and query the system for the state of all
system modules.

::

    root@am335x-evm:~# lsmod
    Module                  Size  Used by
    cryptodev              11962  0 
    root@am335x-evm:~#

After the modules are installed, OpenSSL commands may be executed which
take advantage of the hardware accelerators through the Cryptodev
driver. The following example demonstrates the OpenSSL built-in speed
test to demonstrate performance. The addition of the parameter **-engine
cryptodev** tells OpenSSL to use the Cryptodev driver if it exists.

When the cryptodev driver is removed, OpenSSL reverts to the software
implementation of the crypto algorithm. The performance using the
software only implementation can be compared to the previous test.
